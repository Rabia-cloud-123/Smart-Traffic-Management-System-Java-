# Smart-Traffic-Management-System-Java-
The Smart Traffic Management System is a Java-based project designed to simulate and manage traffic flow using graph-based algorithms. The system models road networks as graphs and applies traversal and path-finding techniques to analyze routes, congestion, and dynamic traffic conditions

# Key Features
Graph-based representation of road networks
Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal for route exploration
Handling of dynamic traffic conditions (e.g., blocked or high-cost paths)
Modular and extensible Java design
Clear separation of logic for nodes, edges, and graph operations

# Technologies Used
Language: Java
Concepts: Graph Algorithms, BFS, Data Structures
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
